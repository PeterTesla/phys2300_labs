# phys2300_labs - LAB 6

STUDENT NOTES: 

	I ended up doing all tasks first then splitting them into the individual files to do what the exact tasks require. I left in
graphing for the animations because I thought it was nice to have both and it looks really nice, especially for the two pendulum example.
Also I ended up coding a pendulum class that I think was the most elegant solution. Plus now I have a modular pendulum class in python I can just 
easily apply wherever I want.
